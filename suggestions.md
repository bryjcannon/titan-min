Needs stronger memory, smarter attention, sturdier training, richer evals, and a path to scale. Near term: add metrics, clipping/LR scheduling, and docs. Mid term: upgrade memory and attention; optimize with flash/mixed-precision. Long term: explore new memory architectures, multi-tasking, and theory.

### Key Points

#### Memory (biggest gaps)

Limits: tiny fixed buffer, fixed segment size, simplistic “surprise.”

Fixes: enlarge/adapt buffer, content-aware segmentation, richer surprise signal (combine gradients, attention, confidence).

#### Attention

Add sparse patterns for long sequences, relative position encodings, and multi-scale heads.

Optionally swap in sparse/flash attention modules.

#### Training

Introduce LR scheduling, gradient clipping, early stopping.

Use auxiliary losses (e.g., memory consistency) alongside task loss.

#### Evaluation

Track memory utilization, surprise distributions, attention entropy/diversity, and retrieval/recall accuracy.

Visualize attention to interpret behavior.

#### Scalability & Performance

Current O(n²) attention and memory module add ~15–20% overhead.

Scale via flash attention, dynamic batching, gradient checkpointing, and mixed-precision.

Model size ~1–5M params; activation/memory footprint standard for small transformers.

#### Roadmap

##### Short term (1–2 weeks):

Add memory/attention metrics & visualizations.

Stabilize training (clipping, LR schedule, early stopping).

Hyperparameter optimization - learning rate, weight decaysurprise threshold, memory size, segment size, persistent memory size, etc.

Improve documentation (APIs, diagrams, examples).

##### Medium term (1–2 months):

Memory: hierarchical structures, content-aware segmentation, advanced surprise.

Attention: sparse + relative positions + multi-scale heads.

Performance: flash attention, FP16, dynamic batching.

##### Long term (3–6 months):

Novel memory: external banks, retrieval-augmented designs, adaptive sizing.

Multi-task: task-specific memory modules and transfer learning.

Theory: analyze memory capacity, surprise effectiveness, and attention interpretability.
